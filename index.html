Greetings! I'm rooir, a hobbyist developer from down under.

I'm working on building a connected resource platform, so this'll change often.

Each page on this project is completely self-contained for easier downloading and archiving.
Simply pressing Ctrl + S on any page, then selecting type: HTML only, works.

This platform will contain content I write, which some may find offensive.
As I owe nobody with this project, I won't apologise for my views.
